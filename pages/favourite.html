                    Lagman is one of the most delicious dishes of the national Uzbek cuisine. The composition of the dish is very simple, but in the hands of the master it turns into a real masterpiece of culinary art. Where did Lagman come from and whose national dish was originally - a mystery. The roots of this appearance go back to the distant past of China. Subsequently, the recipe was modified and supplemented with the influence of the Uighurs, Dungans and other ethnic groups.</p>
